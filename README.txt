Hello everyone!!! I'm Kasundi Vemalya of index number 216134A and welcome to my first Git project. 

My Project

This is a simple Python project with classes for a car, a bike, and a truck. Each class is in a separate file, and there is a main file to run the program.

Files:-

- `car.py`: Contains the `Car` class.
- `bike.py`: Contains the `Bike` class.
- `truck.py`: Contains the `Truck` class (added by a collaborator).
- `main.py`: The main file to run the program.

How to Run

- To run the program, execute `main.py`
